Examples
=========

To test out NcCut you can download some example files from here: `https://zenodo.org/records/14525966 <https://zenodo.org/records/14525966>`_:


* ``example.jpg`` is a SAR image of sea ice floes in the arctic ocean from the Sentinel-1 satellite
* ``orthogonal_project_example.json`` is an example project file output from ``example_4v.nc`` to practice uploading projects with the orthogonal chain tool.
* ``inline_project_example.json`` is an example project file output from ``example_4v.nc`` to practice uploading projects with the inline chain tool.
* ``example_3d.nc`` is a subsection of a modeled ocean temperature dataset from the MITgcm LLC4320 Model near the gulf stream
* ``example_4v.nc`` is a dataset of various ocean circulation metrics calculated from velocity data from the MITgcm LLC4320 Model near the gulf stream
* ``test_img.png`` is simply an image of a square to use to validate the transect tools' accuracy
* ``test_project_file.json`` is another example project file for practicing uploading project files
