Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add features, tests, suggestions, whatever the like but please follow the following guidelines to smooth the process.

# Testing and Submissions

- Please submit a pull request for any additions. Any additions will be automatically tested upon submission via workflows.
- If you are adding significant features to the GUI please include tests similar to those found in the [testing](test_app.py) file to ensure backwards compatibility with the GUI.
- Include instructions on how to use your feature in the repository instructions

# Code style

- Please follow [PEP-8]( <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>) standards as much as possible, though readibility and consistency are paramount.

# Issues

- Please submit any bugs or issues with the GUI through GitHub issues
- Include as much information as possible such as your operating system, python version, and *steps to reproduce the issue*. If possible include the file you are using with the viewer.
