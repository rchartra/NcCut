Usage:

    Loading a File:

        1. To load an image file or .nc file type the relative file path into entry box
        2. Click "Go"
            - If you are loading an .nc file a popup window will appear listing the data variables
              in your file
            - Select the variable you wish to view
        3. You can scroll to zoom in and out of the image, and you can click and drag the image to
           move it around. Clicking the "Rotate" button will rotate the image clockwise 45 degrees.
            - Any transects currently on the image will move along with the image

        * A sample image and sample NetCDF file are included if you'd like to test with an example

    Tools:

        There are currently 3 tool options available:
        - To exit any of the transect modes at any point you can click any of the tool buttons

        * Single Transect:
            Make a single cut between two points.
                - Hit the "Single Transect" button to enter transect mode
                - Click on the two points you want to make a transect between
                - A popup will appear with a plot of the transect and downloading options
                - Click anywhere around the popup to dismiss

        * Multiple Transects:
            Make multiple transects at a time
                - Hit the "Multiple Transect" button to enter transect mode
                - For each transect you want to make click on the beginning and end points
                - When you are done making transects click the download button in the lower
                  right corner
                - A popup will appear with a plot of the transects and downloading options
                - Click anywhere around the popup to dismiss

        * Marker:
            Follow along a feature and make perpendicular transects
                - Hit the "Marker" button to enter transect mode
                - Click points along the feature you want transects of
                - A line will be drawn between the clicked points and two dots will appear
                  denoting the orthogonal cut the tool will make
                - When you are done click the download button in the lower right corner
                - A popup will appear with a plot of the transects and downloading options
                - Click anywhere around the popup to dismiss

                - To change the width of the transects being made at any time you may enter
                  a number of pixels into the text box in the lower left corner.
                     * Hitting "Go" will change the width of future transects made. It will not
                       change the width of past transects.
                     * The width must be an integer between 0 and 400

        * Multiple Marker:
            Use multiple markers in a row and save them all to one folder
                - Hit "Multiple Marker" button to enter transect mode
                - Begin clicking right away to use your first marker
                - When done select new line and begin clicking to use the next marker
                - When finished, select the download button and enter the name of the folder
                    - This folder will be created in your current directory and each marker's
                      csv file will be inside, labeled as they are on the image
                - You can update the width of the current marker as with the single Marker mode
                    - The width will reset to the default when you make a new line
                - Hit delete to delete the current marker
                - To clear the image of markers hit any of the four mode buttons on the right

Data:

    - Selecting the "Download to CSV" button on the popup window will download a .csv file to
      the current directory containing three columns per transect taken:
          - The X coordinate of each point along the transect
          - The Y coordinate of each point along the transect
          - The value of each point along the transect
               - If the transect was taken across an image the value will be the mean of the
                 interpolated RGB values at that point
               - If the transect was taken across a NetCDF file the value will be the
                 interpolated data point at that coordinate in the .nc file

          * NOTE FOR MARKERS
                - The CSV file will contain two columns labeled "Click X" and "Click Y" which contain
                  the coordinates of the points you clicked when making the transect
                - These are the first two columns in the CSV file
